# Write control/state machine that tracks program state.
# Roles:
#   1. Trigger capture
#   2. Give updates to webcam
#   3. Process classifictions
#   4. Command robot
#  
# Could rewrite webcam to only do the wecam sequence inside the state machine.
# That way the control would trigger capture, change capture, mask and classification flags.
# It could change box color, it could send messages, it could change text.
# 
# Other option is to send stuff over message queue to webcam like get_gesture which would trigger
# webcam -> segmentor -> classifier -> validator -> control pipeline.
# During pipeline control could update send webcam status updates on message queue.
# Webcam should then be refactored. #
